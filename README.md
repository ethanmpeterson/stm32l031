# Bare Metal Project Template: STM32L031
This repository contains an example C project for the STM32L031 microcontroller.
Basic CMSIS headers for register access are provided in addition to an example
MakeFile which pulls in FreeRTOS.


NOTE: This repository is still a work in progress. However, it serves as a
foundation for those looking to avoid STM32CUBE IDE generated projects.
